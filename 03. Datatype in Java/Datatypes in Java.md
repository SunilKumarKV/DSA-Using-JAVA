# Primitive Data Types:

Java's primitive data types are the basic building blocks of data manipulation. primitive data types are the simplest form of data and are not objects. Each primitive data type has a specific size and range. Hereâ€™s a detailed overview:

## 1.byte:
  - **Size**: 8-bit
  - **Range**: -128 to 127
  - **Use Case**: Useful for saving memory in large arrays, where the memory savings actually matters. Also used for file I/O.

## 2.short:
  - Size: 16-bit
  - Range: -32,768 to 32,767
  - Use Case: Also used to save memory in large arrays, similar to byte, though less commonly.

## 3.int:
  - **Size**: 32-bit
  - **Range**: -2^31 to 2^31-1 (i.e., -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647)
  - Use Case: The most commonly used integer type. Suitable for most calculations that don't require large values.

## 4.long:
  - **Size**: 64-bit
  - **Range**: -2^63 to 2^63-1 (i.e., -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807)
  - Use Case: Used when a wider range than int is needed. For example, when dealing with large data sets or calculations involving very large numbers.

## 5.float:
  - **Size**: 32-bit
  - **Precision**: Approximately 7 decimal digits
  - Use Case: Used for floating-point arithmetic where less precision is acceptable. For instance, in calculations involving real numbers with a lower precision requirement.

## 6.double:
  - **Size**: 64-bit
  - **Precision**: Approximately 15 decimal digits
  - Use Case: The default choice for floating-point numbers where higher precision is required. Used in most mathematical calculations involving real numbers.

## 7.char:
  - **Size**: 16-bit
  -   Represents a single 16-bit Unicode character
  -   Use Case: Used to represent a single 16-bit Unicode character. For example, when working with text.

## 8.boolean:
  - **Size**: JVM-specific (but generally 1 bit)
  - **Values**: true or false
  - Use Case: Represents true or false values. Commonly used in conditional statements and loops.

Each of these primitive types is designed to provide efficient and straightforward operations for handling basic data in Java applications. They are essential for performance and memory management, and understanding their characteristics helps in writing effective Java code.

# Non-Primitive Data Types:

In Java, non-primitive data types are also known as reference data types. Unlike primitive data types, which store actual values, reference data types store references to objects. They are more complex and flexible, allowing you to create and manipulate objects. Here are the main categories of non-primitive data types in Java:

## 1. Classes.
Classes are blueprints for creating objects. A class defines a set of properties (fields) and methods that the objects       created from the class can use.

 - **Example**:

```bash
public class Car {
    String model;
    int year;
    
    void start() {
        System.out.println("Car started");
    }
}

Car myCar = new Car();
myCar.model = "Toyota";
myCar.year = 2022;
myCar.start();
```

## 2. Objects
Objects are instances of classes. They are created using the new keyword and can access the methods and fields defined in their class.

 - **Example**:

```bash
Car myCar = new Car();  // myCar is an object of the Car class
```

## 3. Arrays
Arrays are collections of elements of the same type, stored in contiguous memory locations. Arrays can hold either primitive types or objects.

 - **Example**:

```bash
int[] numbers = new int[5]; // Array of integers
numbers[0] = 10;
numbers[1] = 20;

String[] names = {"Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"}; // Array of strings
```

## 4. Strings
Strings are objects that represent sequences of characters. Java provides a built-in String class to handle text.

 - **Example**:

```bash
String greeting = "Hello, World!";
int length = greeting.length();
String upperCaseGreeting = greeting.toUpperCase();
```

## Summary
Non-primitive data types in Java offer a wide range of functionality beyond what primitive types provide. They are essential for working with more complex data structures and managing data in a more flexible way. Understanding and using these types effectively is crucial for developing robust and scalable Java applications.
