Introduction
Let us output a number in Java.

Java has a few lines of code which we write in almost all programs.
These are the first 3 lines that you see in the program to your right. We are going to learn about all of them in some time.

For now, read the Line 6:
System.out.println(12);

This is what we use to output/print anything to the screen. Note that this line contains a (;) semicolon at the end. Semicolon is mandatory at the end of statements in Java.

This code just prints 12 on the screen when you run it.
