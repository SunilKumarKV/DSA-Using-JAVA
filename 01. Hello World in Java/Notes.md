## Introduction
Let us output a number in Java.

Java has a few lines of code which we write in almost all programs.
These are the first 3 lines that you see in the program to your right. We are going to learn about all of them in some time.

For now, read the Line 6:
System.out.println(12);

This is what we use to output/print anything to the screen. Note that this line contains a (;) semicolon at the end. Semicolon is mandatory at the end of statements in Java.

This code just prints 12 on the screen when you run it.

## Printing text
In the last problem, we saw how to print a number (using System.out.println).

Let's see how to output some text.

There is only one difference with printing a number: all textual content should start and end with double quotes ("").

For example, we output a number like this
---
**NOTE**
System.out.println(10);
---

But to output a text, we do this
---
**NOTE**
System.out.println("I love Java");
