# Understanding the default code
Let's learn about the different elements of a Java program:

Let's take this example code:
```
class HelloWorld
{
	public static void main (String[] args)
	{
		System.out.println(12 + 7);
	}
}
```
1. **Class Declaration:** class Codechef:

  - This line begins with the keyword class, which tells Java that you're defining a new class.
  - HelloWorld is the name of this class. In Java, every piece of code lives inside a class.
  - Note that there is no semicolon at the end of class declaration.

2. **Main Method:** public static void main (String[] args):

  - This line defines the "main method". It's like the main entrance to a house; the execution of a Java program starts from here.
  - We will learn more about it when we learn about functions and methods.
  - main is the name of this method. It's a special name that Java looks for when running a program.
  - Note that there is no semicolon at the end of Main method.

3. **System.out.print Statement:** System.out.println(12 + 7);

  - We have already learned about this in a previous lesson.
4. **Curly Braces {}:**

  - The opening curly brace { after Codechef and main (String[] args) indicate the start of the class and method block respectively.
  - The closing curly braces } indicate the end of these blocks.
  
This code, when run, will simply display 19 on the screen, which is the sum of 12 and 7.

Don't worry if all of this is a little too much for you. You will get used to all of this as you move ahead in the course.
