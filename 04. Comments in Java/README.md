# Comments in Java

In Java, comments are used to add explanations or annotations to your code, making it easier to understand. They are ignored by the compiler, so they donâ€™t affect the execution of your program. Java supports three types of comments:

1. **Single-Line Comments**: Single-line comments are used to comment out a single line of code. They begin with `//`.

```bash
// This is a single-line comment
int x = 10; // This is also a single-line comment
```

2. **Multi-Line Comments**: Multi-line comments can span multiple lines and are enclosed between `/*` and `*/`. They are useful for commenting out larger blocks of code or providing detailed explanations.

```bash
/*
 * This is a multi-line comment.
 * It spans multiple lines.
 */
int y = 20;
```
3. **Documentation Comments**: Documentation comments are used to generate API documentation. They are enclosed between `/**` and `*/` and are used to describe classes, methods, and fields. These comments can be processed by tools like Javadoc to produce HTML documentation.

```bash
/**
 * This class represents a simple example.
 * It demonstrates the use of documentation comments.
 */
public class Example {
    /**
     * This method prints a greeting message.
     * 
     * @param name the name of the person to greet
     */
    public void greet(String name) {
        System.out.println("Hello, " + name + "!");
    }
}
```
