# Comments in Java

In Java, comments are used to add explanations or annotations to your code, making it easier to understand. They are ignored by the compiler, so they donâ€™t affect the execution of your program. Java supports three types of comments:

1. **Single-Line Comments**: Single-line comments are used to comment out a single line of code. They begin with `//`.

```bash
// This is a single-line comment
int x = 10; // This is also a single-line comment
```

2. **Multi-Line Comments**: Multi-line comments can span multiple lines and are enclosed between `/*` and `*/`. They are useful for commenting out larger blocks of code or providing detailed explanations.

```bash
/*
 * This is a multi-line comment.
 * It spans multiple lines.
 */
int y = 20;
```
